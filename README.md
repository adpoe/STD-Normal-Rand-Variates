# Generating Random Variates from Standard Normal
###Experimental Setup
This Python Code can be used  to algorithmically generate random variates that follow the Standard Normal distribution according to three different methods. For all methods, 10,000 valid random variables were generated in each algorithmâ€™s run, in order to maintain consistency for later effectiveness comparisons. The methods tested were:
1.	The Inverse Transform Method
2.	The Accept/Reject Method
3.	The Polar-Coordinates Method

The code also includes a Chi-Square test to determine whether the data is indeed uniformly distributed, and also visualizations to see the data plotted on histograms.
